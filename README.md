# Neuron Network and Chaos: Construction, Identification, and Prediction of Chaos With a Multilayered Artificial Neural Network
###### Dynamical Systems 2: Hyperbolic Theory (106970, Technion) - Final Project

The project reviews two papers regarding Chaos Neural Networks - an attribute that was usually used without any mathematical proof, up to now.
The authors fill the gap by presenting a mathematical proof of the NN being chaotic, based on Devaney’s definition of chaos.
By using asynchronous iterations they establsih the link between such iterations and Devaney’s chaos, define chaotic dynamical system that finally presents CNN.
  
Following, the latest paper raises the question of the chaotic iterations can be predicted. To answer that, they train several MLPs and try to learn some iterations of this kind. They also show that non-chaotic iterations can also be learned, whereas it is far more difficult for chaotic ones.
